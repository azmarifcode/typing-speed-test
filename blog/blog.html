                            <strong>localStorage and sessionStorage</strong> are relatively new
                            APIs (meaning, not all legacy browsers will support
                            them) and are near identical (both in APIs and
                            capabilities) with the sole exception of
                            persistence. sessionStorage (as the name suggests)
                            is only available for the duration of the browser
                            session (and is deleted when the tab or window is
                            closed) - it does, however, survive page reloads
                            (source DOM Storage guide - Mozilla Developer
                            Network). Clearly, if the data you are storing needs
                            to be available on an ongoing basis then
                            localStorage is preferable to sessionStorage -
                            although you should note both can be cleared by the
                            user so you should not rely on the continuing
                            existence of data in either case. localStorage and
                            sessionStorage are perfect for persisting
                            non-sensitive data needed within client scripts
                            between pages (for example: preferences, scores in
                            games). The data stored in localStorage and
                            sessionStorage can easily be read or changed from
                            within the client/browser so should not be relied
                            upon for storage of sensitive or security-related
                            data within applications.

                            The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.

                            Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

                            </strong> has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
